#Managing Dependency Direction

# Think of classes as people. Tell them to depend on things that change less often than you do.
# -- Some classes are more likely than others to have changes in requirements
# -- Concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes
# -- Changing a class tha has many dependants will result in widespread consequences.

# depending on abstraction is always safer than concretion


# Chapter 4 - Creating Flexible Interfaces

# - A OO App is more than just classes. It is made up of classes but defined by messages
# Clases control whats in your source code repository; messages reflect the living application.

# A class is like a kitchen. It exists to fulfill a single responsibilty but has many methods.
# some methods are public like menu others are private like how to make the food.

# Public Interface - The face it presents to the world
# -- Reveal primary responsibility
# -- Expected to be invoked by others
# -- Will not change on a whim
# -- Are safe for others to depend on
# -- Are thoroughly documented in the tests

# -- Public Interfaces rule of thumb list
# -- Be explicitly identified as such
# -- Be more about what than how
# -- Have names that, insofar as you can anticipate, will not change
# -- Take a hash as an options parameter

# Private Interfaces - All others in the class
# -- Handle implentation details
# -- Are not expected to be sent by other objects
# -- Can change for any reason whatsoever
# -- Are unsafe for others to depend on
# -- May not even be referenced in the tests

# Public, Protected, and Private are used to indicate which methods are stable or unstable
# -- They also control how visible a method is to other parts of your application.

# Private - denotes the least stable kind of method and provides most restricted visibility.
# -- These methods must be called with an implicit receiver and may never be called with explicit receiver.
# --- If class Trip contains private method fun you cannot send self.fun from within Trip or a_trip.fun from another object.
# you may send fun defaulting to self from witihin instances of Trip and its subclasses

# Protected - indicates unstable method, but with different visibility restrictions. Allow explicit receivers
# as long as receiver is self or instance of same class or subclass of self.
# -- self.fun is possible but only from within a class where self is the same thing as a_trip

# Public methods indicate a stable method. They are visible everywhere

# Law of Demeter
# - Prohibits routing a message to a third object via a second object of a different type.
# - "Only talk to your immediate neighbors" - "Use only one dot"
# hash.keys.sort.join("") is reasonable. customer.bicycle.wheel.rotate is not.

# Chapter 7 Sharing Role Behavior with Modules
# before using classical inheritance to solve all of lifes problems think about what happens when you need a recumbent mountain bike! ahh!
# This is just one example of how inheritance can go awry.
# Always thing of costs and benefits of each coding style.

# Finding Roles
 # The preparer duck type from chapter 5 is role. Objects that implement preparers interface play this role. 
 # The existence of a preparer role shows that there is also a parallel preparable role. The trip class acts as a preparable.
 # It implements the preparable interface. This includes all the messages that any preparer might expect to send to a preparable.

# Modules
	# Methods can be defuned in a module and then the module can be added to any object. Modules allow objects of dif lasses to play a common role using a single set of code
	# Methods defined in a module become available via automatic delegation.
	# The total set of messages and object can respond includes:
		# Those it Implements
		# Those implemented in all objects above it in the hierarchy
		# Those implemented in any module that has been added to it.
		# Those implemented in all modules added to any object above it in the hierarchy.

# It is also possible to add a modules methods to a single object, using the extend keyword. Page 300 of 623 shows a diagram of te hierarchy.

# Writing Inheritable Code.
	# The usefulness and maintainability of inheritance hierarchies and modules is in direct proportion to the quality of the code.
		# Recognize Antipatterns.
			# an object that uses a variable with a name like type or category to determine what message to send to self contains
			#two highly related but slightly different types. 

			# when sending object checks the class of a receiving object to determin what message to send , you may have overlooked a chance to ducktype
			# In addition to sharing an interface ducktypes might also share behavior. When they do place the sahred code in a module and include that module in each class or object that 
			#plays that role.

		# Insist on Abstraction
			# All code in an abstraction should apply to every class that inherits it.
			# Superclasses should not contain code that applies to some, but not ak, subclasses.
			#this restriction applie to modules as well.
			# sublclasses taht rais an exception lie "does not implement" come close to declaring they are not that thing.
